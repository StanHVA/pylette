# Pylette #

This is a project I've created to improve my Python skills. I've never OOP coded before in any language, so I thought I'd give it a try. If you have improvements __please!__ open an 'issue' or send me a message so I can learn from my mistakes.
 
 ### Features ###
  * Support for multiple players (infinite amount).
  * A summary of the round after it is played.
  * A super graphical command line interface.
  * The history of your choices and winnings are saved, but never showed. You could code this as an extra feature.
  * Every user input is checked.
  * You can change the multipliers to follow either American or European rules of roulette.

 ### Requirements ###
 
  * Python 3
  
Copy and paste whatever you want to copy paste, just know that this is not really written very properly and many things can and should be improved.
